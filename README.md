🚀 Personal Portfolio — Harsh Mrigank

This repository contains the source code for my personal portfolio website, built to showcase my projects, technical skills, and background as a full-stack developer with a strong focus on backend fundamentals.

The site is intentionally minimal, fast, and content-first — designed to reflect real engineering work rather than flashy UI abstractions.

🧠 About the Portfolio

This portfolio highlights:

Backend-oriented projects (compiler construction, REST APIs)

Core computer science fundamentals

Clean, maintainable frontend built to support the content — not overshadow it

The goal is credibility over exaggeration: every skill and project listed here is something I can clearly explain and defend in technical discussions.

🛠️ Tech Stack
Frontend

React

Next.js

TypeScript

Tailwind CSS

Framer Motion (animations)

Tooling

Vite

Git & GitHub

Netlify (deployment)

📌 Featured Projects
🔹 HMSCC — C-like Compiler

From-scratch compiler implementing lexical analysis, parsing, AST construction, semantic analysis, and code generation

Integrated with a Node.js backend to compile and execute code via REST APIs

Focus on correctness, validation, and controlled execution

🔹 Bahhi Khata — Expense Tracker

Backend-first expense tracking application

JWT-based authentication and RESTful APIs

PostgreSQL with normalized schema, constraints, and joins

(Additional projects will be added as they mature.)

🎯 Design Philosophy

Content > decoration

Proof of work > buzzwords

Backend correctness before UI polish

Readable code over clever abstractions

This portfolio evolves as my skills and projects grow.

🚧 Status

🟢 Actively maintained
Planned improvements:

More backend-heavy projects

Editor and UX refinements

Deployment and observability enhancements
